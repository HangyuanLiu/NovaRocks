//! The shipping process's allocation observer (MEM-1 allocation observation).
//!
//! Installs [`AttributingAllocator`] as this process's `#[global_allocator]` and
//! states, once at startup, what that observation covers and what it
//! structurally cannot see.
//!
//! # Why the shipping binary installs the wrapper
//!
//! The observation tier is worth nothing in a test that opts into it. Hard
//! governance knows only what an owner declared, so a real deployment can be
//! honest about every account it keeps and still be over its bound; the only
//! number that closes that gap is the bytes the process actually asked the
//! allocator for, and that number exists only if the wrapper is the process
//! allocator of the binary operators run. Declaring it here — in the server
//! *library*, not in `main` — is also what lets it observe allocations made
//! before `main` is entered, because a `#[global_allocator]` static is
//! resolved at link time rather than installed by code.
//!
//! # What a reading here is, and is not
//!
//! It measures inner requested layouts, including the eight-byte source token
//! for user requests at or above the frozen threshold. Lane attribution is
//! observation only: it neither qualifies funding nor changes SQL admission.
//! Small ambient allocations stay process-visible without a query source.
//!
//! Counts and lane facts are independently sampled requested bytes, not physical
//! memory or a settlement proof. The unreachable sources remain typed data in
//! [`CoverageDescriptor::blind_spots`] and are never folded into lane facts.
//!
//! # Startup line, and wave 2
//!
//! [`log_installed`] emits exactly one line, whose field names are frozen:
//! `live_bytes`, `allocations`, `covers`, `blind_spots`; frozen attribution
//! threshold, token, batch and record-capacity fields are appended. It is a statement of
//! coverage at a moment when nothing interesting has been allocated yet, not a
//! measurement — its value is that an operator reading the log knows which
//! sources the process can account for before any query runs.
//!
//! Wave-2 pressure sampling reuses [`snapshot`]: it is allocation-free and
//! lock-free, so a sampler owns its own cadence and its own observed maximum.
//! No peak is kept here, because a peak would need one contended cache line
//! for every allocation in the process.
//!
//! # Which allocator serves the memory
//!
//! jemalloc, behind the `jemalloc` Cargo feature that is on by default. It is
//! the only supported production allocator: its internal statistics are the
//! process's second physical reading, and later governance builds on its size
//! classes. A Rust global allocator is fixed at link time, so the choice is a
//! build choice and never a runtime switch. Building without the feature keeps
//! the system allocator for same-revision baselines and for tools that need
//! it; such a build is not a supported deployment, and it says so through
//! [`process_allocator`] and [`log_allocator_configuration`].
//!
//! jemalloc's defaults are compiled in, background purge threads only on
//! Linux: jemalloc is built without them on macOS, where asking for them makes
//! its initialisation fail. jemalloc also reads `_RJEM_MALLOC_CONF` at start-up
//! and lets it override the compiled defaults, so instead of claiming the
//! environment is ignored, the process logs the configuration that took
//! effect.
