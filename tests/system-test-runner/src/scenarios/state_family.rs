/// Destroy the whole frontend durable store and prove the lake is the truth.

/// The frontend's durable store carries only a catalog desired-state projection
/// and rebuildable accelerators. Wiping it must therefore lose the *attachment*
/// while losing none of the *data*: re-attaching the same warehouse has to
/// reproduce every row from the lake alone.
///
/// Two things make this stronger than "a query still works after a restart".
/// First, the pre-wipe catalog must be observably gone, which is what proves
/// the wipe did anything at all — a wipe that silently removed nothing would
/// otherwise let every later assertion pass for the wrong reason. Second, the
/// post-wipe catalog is a brand-new attachment, so its connector incarnation is
/// freshly minted and the rows it serves cannot have come from frontend state
/// that survived. The backends are deliberately left running, so their warm
/// connector bindings are exactly the thing a weaker assertion would mistake
/// for recovery.
