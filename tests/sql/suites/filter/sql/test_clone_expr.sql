-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Verify expression cloning correctness when semantically equivalent expressions
--    (e.g., `if(a>5 and b>5, ...)` vs `if(b>5 and a>5, ...)`) are reused/shared.
-- 2. Verify ds_hll_count_distinct with reused if-expressions produces consistent results
--    across unnest expansion and repeated inserts.
