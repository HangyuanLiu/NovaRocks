-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate combined LIKE and BETWEEN predicates.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in mixed string+numeric predicate conjunctions.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic string and score rows.
-- 3. Apply LIKE + BETWEEN filter and assert ordered output.
