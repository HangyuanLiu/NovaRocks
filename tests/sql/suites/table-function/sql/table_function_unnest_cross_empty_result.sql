-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate CROSS JOIN LATERAL UNNEST behavior for empty and NULL arrays.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in empty-result handling while preserving output schema header.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Build deterministic rows with per-row array expressions.
-- 2. Expand using CROSS JOIN LATERAL UNNEST.
-- 3. Assert stable empty output (no rows).
