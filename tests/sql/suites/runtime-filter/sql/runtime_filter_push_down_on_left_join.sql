-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate that runtime filter is NOT incorrectly pushed through LEFT JOIN
--    onto columns produced by COALESCE on the left side.
-- 2. The outer join produces c2 via coalesce(t2.c2, 'unknown')='c2-1',
--    but t3 has c2='unknown', so the final join should return 0 rows.
-- 3. Cover both broadcast and shuffle variants of the left join.

-- query 2
-- Left join [broadcast]: coalesce output c2='c2-1' must NOT be incorrectly used
-- to push RF into t1 scan, because the final join to t3 requires c2='unknown'.
-- Expected: 0 rows (coalesce result 'c2-1' != t3.c2 'unknown').
