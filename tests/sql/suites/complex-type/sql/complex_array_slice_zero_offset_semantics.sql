-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate ARRAY_SLICE offset=0 semantics match StarRocks (empty result).
-- 2. Prevent regressions where offset=0 is treated as start-from-first-element.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Build deterministic array literals.
-- 2. Evaluate ARRAY_SLICE with zero, positive, and negative offsets.
-- 3. Assert projected arrays.
