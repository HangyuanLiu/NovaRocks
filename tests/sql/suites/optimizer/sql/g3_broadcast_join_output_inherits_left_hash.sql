-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Lock in the G3 contract: a BROADCAST Inner Join preserves its left
--    child's distribution through passthrough join output derivation.
--    G4 source-aware semantics then require a ShuffleAgg exchange before
--    a downstream Window keyed on a narrower analytic partition.
-- 2. Regression guard for "Broadcast preserves left output" + the
--    G4 rule that ShuffleJoin output does not satisfy narrower ShuffleAgg.
