-- Test Objective: RankingWindowPredicatePushdown must NOT fire when:
--   (a) the window contains a non-ranking aggregate (avg) alongside rank,
--   (b) the filter only gives a lower bound (rk >= 2, no finite upper bound),
--   (c) PARTITION BY is empty (rank over the full set, no per-partition truncation).
-- Each sub-case asserts @explain_not_contains=partition_limit= and captures
-- result rows so future refactors stay correct.

-- Guard (d): Window has two ranking fns with DIFFERENT ORDER BY signatures
-- (rank() ORDER BY amount DESC and rank() ORDER BY region ASC).
-- The analytic Sort is keyed on the FIRST window's order; setting partition_limit
-- would truncate each partition by amount-order and corrupt the region-ordered rank.
