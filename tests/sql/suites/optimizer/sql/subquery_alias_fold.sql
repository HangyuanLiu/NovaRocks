-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Derived-table aliases are carried as an identity Project's output_qualifier
--    (predicate-pushdown rework), not as a dedicated alias plan operator.
-- 2. Derived-table column aliases still expose the renamed output column.
-- 3. Single-use CTE inline keeps a real join plan (no dedicated alias operator).
