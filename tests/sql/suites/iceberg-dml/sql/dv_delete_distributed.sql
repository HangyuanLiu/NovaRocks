-- Test Point: Iceberg v3 deletion-vector DELETE writes distributed BE-side Puffin DVs and merges a second delete into the existing DV.
-- Method: create a bucket-partitioned v3 row-lineage table, insert multiple files, run two DELETE statements, then verify the remaining rows.
-- Scope: standalone Iceberg v3 DELETE, distributed DeletionVectors sink, RowDeltaDvFromFiles commit
