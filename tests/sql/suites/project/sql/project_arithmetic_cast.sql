-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate arithmetic projection with nullable inputs.
-- 2. Validate explicit cast projection in the same operator pipeline.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows including NULL arithmetic operands.
-- 3. Project computed columns and assert ordered output.
