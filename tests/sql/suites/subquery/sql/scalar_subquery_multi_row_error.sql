-- Test Objective: A scalar subquery that returns more than one row must raise a
-- runtime AssertOneRow error.  This is the base guarantee that
-- RankingWindowPredicatePushdown must not change: returning >1 row in a scalar
-- position must always error, regardless of whether the rule fires or not.
