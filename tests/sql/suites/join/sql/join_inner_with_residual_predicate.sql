-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate INNER JOIN with additional residual predicate in ON clause.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where residual filters are ignored after key matching.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset left and right tables.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows with both passing and failing residual conditions.
-- 3. Execute INNER JOIN with residual predicate and assert output.
