-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Force a partitioned hash join whose producer fragment has multiple
--    participants and shares at least one BE with a distinct consumer fragment.
-- 2. Prove the native runtime-filter service actively prunes the shared probe path.
-- 3. Keep the result identical with runtime-filter placement disabled and enabled.
--    The exact local-shard missing-key counterexample is covered by the paired
--    deterministic pipeline fixture; this case supplies the actual 1FE+3BE topology.
