-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate ORDER BY + LIMIT/OFFSET semantics when requested top-k is much larger than heap threshold.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in large-k page slicing behavior.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows with score ties.
-- 3. Query ORDER BY + LIMIT/OFFSET where limit+offset is large enough to hit large-k topn path.
