-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate UNION DISTINCT deduplicates FLOAT/DOUBLE NaN values.
-- 2. Prevent hash-key equality regressions where NaN rows are treated as distinct.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Build two identical NaN rows via constant SELECTs.
-- 2. Apply UNION DISTINCT.
-- 3. Assert only one distinct row remains.
