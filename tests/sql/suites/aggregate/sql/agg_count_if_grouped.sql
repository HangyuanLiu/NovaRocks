-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate grouped count_if semantics with deterministic ordering.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in partial/final merge handling for count_if.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset grouped source table.
-- 2. Insert rows that exercise true/false/null predicate outcomes.
-- 3. Group by key and assert ordered count_if outputs.
