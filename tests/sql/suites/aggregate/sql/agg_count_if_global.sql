-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate global count_if semantics after FE rewrite to count_if(1, predicate).
-- 2. Prevent regressions where rewrite constants are incorrectly counted as data input.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset the source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows including NULL.
-- 3. Assert global count_if outputs.
