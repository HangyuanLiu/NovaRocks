-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate MAP_AGG materialization and key extraction.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in map aggregate state merge/finalization.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset key-value source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic grouped key-value rows.
-- 3. Aggregate to map and extract keys for assertions.
