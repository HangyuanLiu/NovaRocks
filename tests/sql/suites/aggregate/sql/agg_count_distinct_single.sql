-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate COUNT(DISTINCT) on grouped string keys.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in distinct-state aggregation across groups.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert duplicate and NULL-contained rows.
-- 3. Compute grouped COUNT(DISTINCT) and assert deterministic order.
