-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN on an Iceberg table preserves COUNT(*).
-- 2. Verify the new column is visible with NULL backfill after schema change.
-- Iceberg ALTER is synchronous at metadata commit, so no sleep/retry is needed
-- between the ALTER and the follow-up reads.
