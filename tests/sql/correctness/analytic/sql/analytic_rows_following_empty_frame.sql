-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate ROWS FOLLOWING window-frame behavior when tail rows produce empty frames.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where empty frames return non-NULL SUM or non-zero COUNT(expr).
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic ordered rows with nullable values.
-- 3. Compute SUM/COUNT over FOLLOWING frame and assert ordered output.
