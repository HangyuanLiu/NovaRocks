-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate FIRST_VALUE/LAST_VALUE under full window frame.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where LAST_VALUE incorrectly uses current-row frame.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic ordered rows.
-- 3. Compute FIRST_VALUE/LAST_VALUE with full frame and assert output.
