-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate ROW_NUMBER/RANK/DENSE_RANK semantics with ties.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in ranking gap behavior under duplicate sort keys.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset analytic source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows with tie scores.
-- 3. Compute ranking functions and assert ordered output.
