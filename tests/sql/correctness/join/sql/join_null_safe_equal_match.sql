-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate NULL-safe equality join (`<=>`) matches NULL join keys in hash join paths.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where probe/build NULL keys are skipped as unmatched.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset left and right tables with nullable join keys.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows including duplicated NULL keys on both sides.
-- 3. Execute INNER JOIN with `<=>` and assert NULL-key multiplicity is preserved.
