-- Test Objective:
-- Keep complete-group TopN results reachable independently of the unsupported
-- Global ordered-filter queries earlier in compressed_key.sql. Preserve that
-- case and its original results; this case does not qualify its skipped tail.
-- Inputs: the original 24-column table, 30002 rows, DOP 2, and concat limit.
-- Oracle: verbatim compressed_key.result blocks 137-140, with markers mapped
-- to 8-11. No expected value is recorded from this implementation.
-- Maintained by the aggregate/runtime-filter owners; run with the aggregate
-- suite when those owners change and before merging related changes. The SQL
-- runner owns case database isolation, suite cleanup, and cluster shutdown.
