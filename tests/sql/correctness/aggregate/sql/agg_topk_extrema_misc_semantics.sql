-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate approx_top_k, min_n, average-on-expression, and mann_whitney_u_test semantics.
-- 2. Cover grouped and nullable inputs without relying on external schemas.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset a mixed scalar source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic duplicates, NULLs, and boolean cohorts.
-- 3. Snapshot top-k, extrema arrays, aggregate expression averages, and Mann-Whitney outputs.
