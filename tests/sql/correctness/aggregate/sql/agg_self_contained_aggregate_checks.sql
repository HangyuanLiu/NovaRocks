-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate mixed aggregate metrics over customer and lineorder-like data.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where this case depends on shared SSB fixture tables.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset minimal source tables for customer and lineorder metrics.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows that include both filter-hit and filter-miss branches.
-- 3. Aggregate metrics and order by metric name for stable comparison.
