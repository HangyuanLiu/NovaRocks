-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate variance/stddev family aggregates on grouped data.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in statistical aggregate formulas.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic numeric rows for two groups.
-- 3. Compute rounded variance/stddev metrics and assert ordered output.
