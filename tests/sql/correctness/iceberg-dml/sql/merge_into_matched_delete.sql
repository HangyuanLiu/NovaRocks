-- Test Point: Iceberg v3 MERGE INTO with a single `WHEN MATCHED THEN DELETE`
--             branch removes exactly the matched rows and preserves row lineage.
-- Method: load a v3 row-lineage table with three rows (ids 1,2,3). MERGE in a
--         single-row source (id=2) with only a matched-DELETE clause. Verify
--         rows 1 and 3 remain (row 2 is removed via its deletion vector) and
--         that `_row_id` values stay unique.
-- Scope:  standalone Iceberg DDL/DML, MERGE INTO WHEN MATCHED THEN DELETE.
-- Phase 3 M2: matched-DELETE writes its deletion vector on the BE
--         (DeletionVectors sink), committed via RowDeltaDvFromFiles. FE commits
--         metadata only; the coordinator no longer materializes position groups.
