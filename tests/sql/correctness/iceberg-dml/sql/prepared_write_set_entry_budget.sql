-- NCP-6 bounds acceptance: an over-limit distributed write is refused, and the
-- refusal leaves no partial snapshot behind.
--
-- The prepared write set's entry budget is the one frozen budget a plain SQL
-- statement can actually drive to its boundary, because an Iceberg partitioned
-- INSERT writes exactly one data file -- and therefore exactly one commit
-- fragment -- per distinct partition value, independent of chunking and of
-- writer-driver parallelism.
--
-- The budget itself is asserted against its named constant by the unit tests
-- that own it (MAX_CONNECTOR_PREPARED_WRITE_SET_ENTRIES in
-- novarocks/spi/src/connector/write_stack/limits.rs, exercised in
-- .../write_stack/prepared.rs). SQL cannot name a Rust constant, so this case
-- restates the value once, as 32 * 32 * 16 + 1 = 16385 partition values: one
-- entry past the 16384 the design froze. Raising or lowering the budget makes
-- this case fail loudly rather than quietly stop testing -- an unexpected
-- success is a runner failure, not a pass.
--
-- This case deliberately writes 16385 tiny files, so it runs for roughly a
-- minute and a half. That cost is the budget: there is no shortcut to the
-- boundary of an entry count.
