-- Test Objective:
-- DELETE whose deleted rows for a single data file span more than one chunk.
--
-- Iceberg permits one deletion vector per data file, so every deleted row of a
-- file has to reach one writer. The exchange hashes the delete branch by _file,
-- but that only routes a file to one fragment instance; the instance's drivers
-- each own a writer and pull from one shared receiver, so without a driver-level
-- shuffle two of them stage a vector for the same file and the commit is refused
-- as corrupt. A file whose deleted rows fit in a single chunk cannot expose that
-- -- one chunk goes to one driver whatever the routing -- which is why the rest
-- of this suite stayed green while the bug was live.
--
-- Each INSERT is gathered by its ORDER BY so it lands in exactly one data file,
-- and the predicate then deletes far more than one chunk's worth of rows from
-- every one of them.
