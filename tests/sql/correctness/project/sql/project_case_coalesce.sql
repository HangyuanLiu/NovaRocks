-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate CASE-WHEN projection with nullable branches.
-- 2. Validate COALESCE normalization in the same projected row set.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert rows covering grade boundaries and NULL values.
-- 3. Project CASE and COALESCE expressions, then assert ordered output.
