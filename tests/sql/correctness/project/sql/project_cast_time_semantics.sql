-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate CAST(... AS TIME) literal parsing semantics.
-- 2. Distinguish direct string-to-time cast from datetime-to-time cast path.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Cast canonical and extended-hour time strings.
-- 2. Cast datetime/date values to TIME.
-- 3. Assert deterministic scalar output.
