-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate ABS on LARGEINT boundary values follows FE planned LARGEINT semantics.
-- 2. Prevent BIGINT-overflow style regression where ABS(min_bigint_literal) wraps to negative.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Execute deterministic projection-only query (no table dependency).
-- 2. Assert ABS result, comparison against BIGINT max, and +1 arithmetic on the same row.
