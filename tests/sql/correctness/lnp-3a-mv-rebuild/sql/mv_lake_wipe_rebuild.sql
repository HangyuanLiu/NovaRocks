-- This case is intentionally executed only as cross-process 1FE+3BE. It
-- proves that a published, paused, non-default async MV survives an
-- Accelerator wipe and later resumes with the same lake authority.
--
-- The wipe is the real one: this fixture's Accelerator is cleared and the
-- frontend is restarted, so everything below comes back through startup
-- rediscovery and the lake is the only source it can come from. That is also
-- why the paused state has to be read back rather than assumed -- it lives in
-- the view's own configuration document, and nothing local survives to
-- remember it.
