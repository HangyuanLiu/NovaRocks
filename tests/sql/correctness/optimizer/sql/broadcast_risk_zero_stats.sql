-- Golden derivation: the probe's identity projects reuse generate_series,
-- while generate_series + 0 creates the build's separately named k value.
-- Thus the join/import names become generate_series = k, not k = k.
-- Preserve build filters/projections, both hash exchanges, partitioned join,
-- and the 11250000000000 estimate; no row-count or broadcast policy changes.
