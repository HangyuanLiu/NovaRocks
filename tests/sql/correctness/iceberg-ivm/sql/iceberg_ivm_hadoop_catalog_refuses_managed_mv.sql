-- Test Point: a managed MV is refused on a Hadoop catalog, at admission.
-- Method: attach a Hadoop catalog, create an ordinary base table in it, and
--   ask for a storage_engine='iceberg' MV over that base.
-- Scope: the catalog kind alone decides this. A managed MV keeps its own
--   definition, interpretation, publication and configuration documents in the
--   catalog beside the table, and the Hadoop catalog has nowhere to put them --
--   every other case in this suite is REST for that reason. The refusal must
--   land before any provider effect, so the base table must still be there
--   afterwards and must still be droppable.
