-- Regression: a CTE referenced through multiple aliases with different per-alias
-- predicates must surface independent rows per alias.
--
-- This previously failed because the analyzer reused the CTE producer's
-- column_id list for every consume, so different aliases shared the same
-- ColumnId. Downstream joins, projections, and filters could no longer
-- distinguish the aliases. TPC-DS q11 (and many similar reports queries)
-- collapses to 0 rows when this is broken.
