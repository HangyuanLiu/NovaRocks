-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate ORDER BY on multiple keys with mixed directions.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in tie-breaking behavior for same primary sort key.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic duplicate-key rows.
-- 3. Sort by multiple keys and assert exact row order.
