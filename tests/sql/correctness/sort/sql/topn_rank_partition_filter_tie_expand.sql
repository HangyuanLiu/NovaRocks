-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate rank-based partition topn behavior with tie expansion at partition boundary.
-- 2. Cover FE partition-topn rewrite path for rank window filter predicates.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows with duplicated scores in each partition.
-- 3. Compute RANK over partition and filter with rk <= 2, then assert stable output order.
