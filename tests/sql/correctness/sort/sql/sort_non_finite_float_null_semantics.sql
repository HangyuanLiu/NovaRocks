-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate ORDER BY behavior when float expressions can produce non-finite values.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where NaN/Infinity leak into result/order instead of SQL NULL semantics.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Build a small in-memory set with CAST and math expressions that can produce non-finite values.
-- 2. Sort with explicit NULL ordering and deterministic tie-breakers.
-- 3. Assert that non-finite branches are treated as NULL in output ordering.
