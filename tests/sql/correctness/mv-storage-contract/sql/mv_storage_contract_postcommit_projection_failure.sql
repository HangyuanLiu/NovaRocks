-- Test Objective:
-- The publication committed and the process that committed it died before it
-- could record the projection. The lake is the authority, so what the commit
-- did stands: the next process must find the published result and serve it.
--
-- What must NOT happen is a compensating Drop or a rollback. A projection this
-- process failed to write is a fact it has not caught up with, not a fact that
-- did not happen, and undoing someone else's committed publication because a
-- local write failed would destroy a result the lake already holds.
