-- Test Objective:
-- One table, referenced twice, is two sources.
--
-- The canonical definition records two relation occurrences of the same
-- object, and every source fact belongs to its own occurrence rather than to
-- the table name they share. So does everything downstream now: base
-- relations, snapshot pins, predecessor facts, the publication provenance and
-- its hashed watermark, and the join's own two sides -- which resolve by the
-- qualifier each was bound under rather than by the table they share.
--
-- What must NOT happen is the two collapsing into one. Keyed by table name the
-- second mention overwrote the first, which is why this shape used to be
-- refused outright rather than published with one mention's pin standing for
-- both.
