-- Test Objective:
-- Two published views, and a startup that only discovers one of them.
--
-- The one it found installs. The one it missed is absent -- and absent is all
-- it is: nothing drops it to make the inventory self-consistent, and its
-- published result stays in the lake untouched. When a later startup sees the
-- whole namespace, the late view installs beside the first, which is not
-- rolled back to make room for it.
--
-- An incomplete listing is a fact about the listing, not about the views.
