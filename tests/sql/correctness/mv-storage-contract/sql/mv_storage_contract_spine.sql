-- Test Objective:
-- The whole MV storage contract in one chain, against the product topology.
-- Every link is a claim the lake alone must carry:
--   1. CREATE writes the view's own documents, and SHOW reads those fields back.
--   2. A first refresh publishes, and the result is both directly readable and
--      cheap enough to rewrite a base query onto.
--   3. Wiping this fixture's Accelerator and restarting the frontend leaves the
--      lake as the only source: the view is still readable afterwards.
--   4. Management is closed after that restart, because an unanswered dispatch
--      from the previous process leaves no trace in the documents. Refresh is
--      refused while it is closed.
--   5. An operator declaration retires that barrier, and only then does a
--      second, explicit full refresh publish again.
-- Incremental refresh is deliberately out of scope here; this gate proves the
-- documents, the recovery and the continuation, not the delta path.
