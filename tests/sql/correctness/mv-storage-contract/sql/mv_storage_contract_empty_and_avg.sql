-- Test Objective:
-- Two publication shapes the storage contract has to carry on the product
-- topology:
--   1. A view over an empty source. Its first refresh produces nothing and
--      must still publish: the view exists, is readable, and has a
--      publication to be rewritten against. A target left without a snapshot
--      would have no version to report and nothing to refresh from later.
--   2. AVG. The published columns are the state the view stores, not the
--      value it shows, so the read has to come back as an average.
