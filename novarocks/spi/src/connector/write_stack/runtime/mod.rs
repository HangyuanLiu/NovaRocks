//! Transport-neutral connector write runtime values.
//!
//! The public values here reveal only an exact binding and neutral facts. Their
//! provider payloads are private to this crate: a role host, the SQL planner,
//! and the execution engine can move them, count them, and hand them back to
//! their owning provider, but they cannot read or construct them. A provider
//! supplies concrete associated types to the generic adapter in the sibling
//! module.
//!
//! Three values cross module boundaries, and each has a different reach:
//!
//! * [`ConnectorWriteCommitHandle`] never leaves the frontend. It is not
//!   `Clone`, has no codec facet, and is borrowed rather than moved by every
//!   terminal call, so it structurally cannot be duplicated into a native
//!   fragment, a state store, a result row, or a backend binding.
//! * [`ConnectorWriterHandle`] is an immutable logical write recipe. It *is*
//!   `Clone`, because one logical target is copied to every physical writer
//!   placement that serves it.
//! * [`ConnectorCommitFragment`] describes one provider artifact produced by
//!   one finished writer. It travels backend to frontend as canonical bytes and
//!   becomes a provider value again only inside the frontend control binding.
