//! The frontend-only external write session.
//!
//! One `begin_write` atomically returns a frontend-only commit handle and the
//! complete set of logical writer handles the sealed plan may use. There is no
//! separate prepare, activate, or placement-dependent planning step: a writer
//! recipe is a property of the logical target, not of where the plan happens to
//! run.
//!
//! Only the frontend, holding its exact control generation, may finish, abort,
//! or reconcile a write. A backend has no commit handle and no catalog
//! mutation capability at all.
