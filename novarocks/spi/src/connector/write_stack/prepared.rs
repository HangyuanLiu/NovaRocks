//! The bounded, complete result of one distributed write's data plane.
//!
//! A prepared write set is complete or it does not exist. There is no partial
//! set, no truncation, no spill, and no "commit what arrived": the frontend may
//! call the provider's finish only with a set that the execution graph closed.
//!
//! Two forms of the same facts exist, and both use the ledger in this module:
//!
//! * while aggregating, the root backend holds canonical encoded bytes it never
//!   interprets;
//! * after the frontend decodes those bytes on its exact control binding, it
//!   holds [`ConnectorPreparedWriteSet`], whose fragments are provider values.
