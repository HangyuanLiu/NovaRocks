//! The deployment's own statement that a previous incarnation is isolated.
//!
//! A restarted process closes management on every target its deployment owns
//! but a previous incarnation wrote, because an unanswered dispatch leaves no
//! trace in the documents. An operator can retire one such barrier per target
//! with a declaration, which does not scale to a deployment that restarts a
//! process holding dozens of them.
//!
//! What does scale is the deployment saying it once, outside this process,
//! about the writer rather than about each target. That statement is what this
//! module carries. It is deliberately not a lease, not an election and not a
//! liveness probe: it asserts that a named incarnation was isolated at a named
//! moment, and the remote-effect window still has to elapse from that moment
//! before anything reopens. Without a configured guarantee for the effect's
//! scope there is no window to elapse, and the deployment stays read-only --
//! which is the default, not a failure.
//!
//! Three bindings keep a statement from outliving its occasion: the deployment
//! it names, the incarnation of the process it was written for, and a nonce
//! the launch supplies. A file left behind by a previous start names a
//! previous nonce, so it cannot readmit anything here.
