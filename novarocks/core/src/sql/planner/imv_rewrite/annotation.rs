//! Single-tenant extension payload for the IMV rewrite pipeline.
//!
//! `RewriteContext::set_extension::<T>()` stores one `Arc<dyn Any + Send + Sync>`.
//! IMV needs both the MV rewrite context handle and a per-pipeline annotation;
//! both ride inside `ImvExtension` so the single slot is sufficient.
