//! The ingress resource gate for compiled-package carriers.
//!
//! A process that composed the compiled-package interpreter receives each
//! task's static plan as the exact bytes of one physical package, the
//! `FrozenFragment.package` carrier. Only the backend that wins a task's
//! creation interprets those bytes, but the package's generated resource
//! preflight runs here, for every decoded create and before any owner
//! classifies the operation's identity. A replay is answered without its body
//! ever being prepared, yet it still cannot carry a package past this
//! boundary that the receiver would refuse to allocate for.
//!
//! The gate proves resource bounds only. The one-carrier law, the package's
//! semantics and every compile refusal stay with the winner's interpreter, so
//! a carrier without a package passes here and is refused there. Task codec
//! keeps no plan-codec dependency: the generated model is consulted only by
//! this Native adapter module. A plan-tree process composes no gate.
