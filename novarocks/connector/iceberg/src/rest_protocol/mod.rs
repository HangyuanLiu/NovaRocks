//! Provider-owned Iceberg REST session, transport, wire models and endpoints.
//! One configuration handshake establishes the generation's immutable route,
//! authentication provenance and capabilities. Every frontend request shares
//! that session; backend credential acquisition uses its frozen routing facts.
