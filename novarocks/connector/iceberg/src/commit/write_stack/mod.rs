//! Iceberg's implementation of the provider-neutral connector write stack.
//!
//! ```text
//! FE begin_write   -> IcebergCommitHandle + [WriteTargetOrdinal -> IcebergWriterHandle]
//! BE open_writer   -> one writer per driver
//!    writer.finish -> zero or more IcebergCommitFragment values, one per artifact
//! FE finish_write  -> exactly one Iceberg snapshot commit
//! ```
//!
//! Two properties distinguish this from the write path it will replace:
//!
//! * a writer's result is a set of independent artifact descriptions rather
//!   than one opaque report document, so the transport never splits a provider
//!   document across frames; and
//! * a delete branch's handle freezes *references* to the old delete artifacts
//!   instead of an already-read bitmap, and the backend does the reading
//!   through its own query-leased storage resolver (NCP-6 D10).
//!
//! The adapter that converts between these concrete values and the neutral
//! `ConnectorWriteCommitHandle` / `ConnectorWriterHandle` /
//! `ConnectorCommitFragment` is `pub(crate)` and is never handed to a role
//! host. `codec` holds it privately too: it is the only module that turns a
//! central-IDL write carrier into one of these values, and it does so only
//! through the domain constructors above.
