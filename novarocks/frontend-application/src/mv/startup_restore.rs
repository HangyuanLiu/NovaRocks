//! Frontend-owned MV startup restore.
//!
//! Installing this makes the frontend the owner of *when* MV state is restored at
//! startup, which is what "Frontend orchestrates through the installed
//! provider/runtime boundary" asks for. The lake-reading work itself stays in the
//! engine, because a production SQL procedure calls the same targeted rebuild; the
//! decision that moved here is the orchestration, not the code.
//!
//! Every input is a port the frontend already holds. Nothing here reaches into
//! aggregate engine state, which is precisely why this implementation can exist.
