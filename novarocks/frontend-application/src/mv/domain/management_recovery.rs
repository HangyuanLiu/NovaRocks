//! What a freshly opened process may assume about the writer before it.
//!
//! A process that rediscovers a materialized view from the lake knows which
//! incarnation wrote its documents, and knows that it is not that incarnation.
//! What it cannot know is whether that writer had an effect in flight when it
//! stopped: an unanswered catalog commit or object deletion leaves no trace in
//! the documents, and assuming there was none is the one assumption that can
//! corrupt the target.
//!
//! So management closes on exactly that possibility. The barrier stands for
//! everything the old incarnation could have dispatched, and only evidence
//! that the old writer can no longer act retires it. Reading the view is
//! unaffected: a published materialization is what the lake says it is.
