//! Generic admission for one distributed procedure's cohort read.
//!
//! A rewrite cohort whose input is not table rows -- re-encoding delete
//! artifacts is the one such procedure -- reads the relation its frozen group
//! names. This module carries that group through SQL planning as a synthetic,
//! query-local relation and hands it back to the same connector generation at
//! preparation. It never resolves the group to artifacts, and never restates
//! the rule that selected it: the same group is what the cohort's commit
//! replaces, and a set re-derived here could differ from it.
