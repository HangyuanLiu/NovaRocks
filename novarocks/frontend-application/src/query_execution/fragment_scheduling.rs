//! What deciding how many backends run each fragment actually needs.
//!
//! Scheduling reads a narrow set of facts: which fragments exist and in what
//! order, which of them read a provider and how that read receives its work,
//! and how rows move between fragments. It reads none of the plan's semantics,
//! so it is given none - which is what lets one scheduler serve a plan in any
//! shape, and what keeps a change in plan representation from reaching it.
