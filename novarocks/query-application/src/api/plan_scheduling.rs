//! What deciding how many tasks to run, and where, reads about one plan.

//! Scheduling reads no semantics. It reads which fragments exist, in what
//! order, which of them read a provider and how much work that read starts
//! with, and how rows flow between fragments. Every one of those is a
//! property both plan representations have, so they are stated here as
//! values rather than reached for through whichever representation produced
