//! Answering a compiler's needs from the owners that hold the answers.
//!
//! Pure compilation asks for exactly the outside facts it is missing, and
//! something has to go and get them. That something is this: one place that
//! knows which owner answers which kind of question, and nothing else. It does
//! not decide what to ask, because the compiler decides that; it does not
//! decide what the answer means, because the owner decides that.
//!
//! Each kind of question goes to exactly one owner, named by a port. Keeping
//! them separate is what stops the catalog from being asked for statistics, or
//! a provider from being consulted about a materialized view - and it means an
//! owner can be exercised on its own, without standing up the others.
