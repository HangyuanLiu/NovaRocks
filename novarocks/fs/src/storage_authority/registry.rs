//! The process-lived home for storage authorities.
//!
//! CAD-1 D10: an authority must outlive the query that first needed it. Every
//! credential structure this replaces was per-attempt — the lease id itself is
//! minted from the query execution id — so a second query over the same table
//! paid for a fresh acquisition and a fresh object-store client. With the
//! executor obtaining its own material that cost would be multiplied by the
//! number of executor nodes, and none of those calls ride anything: an executor
//! reads no metadata, so a credential call it makes is pure overhead.
//!
//! Nothing in this registry is keyed by a query. That is the whole contract.
