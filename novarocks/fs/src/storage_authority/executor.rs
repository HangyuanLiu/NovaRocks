//! Where a credential refresh actually runs.
//!
//! CAD-1 D3 does not merely permit prefetch, it requires that a refresh never
//! occupy the thread that asked for material. The reason is specific to this
//! engine: filesystem reads are driven synchronously from scan threads through
//! `block_on`, and vended credentials across a cluster commonly expire at the
//! same moment. A refresh that borrowed its caller's thread could therefore
//! park a whole scan pool at once, turning one slow catalog into a stalled
//! cluster.
//!
//! `spawn_blocking` is the right primitive rather than `spawn`: an acquisition
//! is a synchronous provider call, so putting it on an async worker would move
//! the stall rather than remove it.
