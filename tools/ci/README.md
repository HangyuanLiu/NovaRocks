# Rust test entry and retained execution materials

`tools/ci/dev-test.sh test` prepares the workspace's development graph and then
executes native nextest in the foreground. Nextest owns per-test processes,
parallel scheduling, TTY progress, input and job control. It requires nextest
**at least 0.9.148**, using the native `nextest-version.required` configuration.
`NOVA_CI_NEXTEST_BIN` can select an isolated `cargo-nextest` executable. Formal
tool preparation and the governance workflow pin **0.9.148**; ordinary development
also accepts compatible newer versions.

```bash
tools/ci/dev-test.sh test
tools/ci/dev-test.sh list -E 'package(novarocks-test-support)'
tools/ci/dev-test.sh test -E 'package(novarocks-test-support) & test(caller_exit)'
tools/ci/dev-test.sh test -E 'binary(process_monitor)'
tools/ci/dev-test.sh test --run-ignored only -E \
  'package(novarocks-cluster-harness) & test(native_proxy_cluster_keeps_advertisement_across_process_restarts)'
tools/ci/dev-test.sh test -E 'rdeps(novarocks-test-support)' --test-threads 2
tools/ci/dev-test.sh doc
tools/ci/dev-test.sh check --target-dir target/ide
```

`package()`, `binary()`, `test()` and `rdeps()` retain nextest's native meaning.
Package, feature, target and Cargo profile switches cannot replace the prepared
workspace graph; use runtime filters for selection. `cargo test -p ...` and bare
`cargo nextest run` remain useful local debugging paths. They do not establish
that the entry's last joint preparation was performed. Pure tests do not create
test-support material roots or retention guards. The first managed operation in
an ordinary nextest call lazily establishes its Rust-owned run lease; this does
not require Python. Nested runners must inherit the context after their outer
test explicitly ensures the lease.

Preparation saves native Cargo metadata, native nextest binaries metadata, the
last `cargo build --workspace --tests --bins --profile dev --locked` JSONL,
the four program bindings/build information, native full selection and actual
executable hashes. The binding checker matches package ID, target name/kind,
test profile and executable path against that final Cargo stream. It validates
the native host and checks hashes again immediately before execution. List and
run then reuse both native metadata files without invoking Cargo. Daily copies
under `target/nextest-prepared/<unique>/` are disposable caches, not retained
formal evidence. Do not concurrently rebuild the same target during a run.

The default configuration has four slots, no retries, no fail-fast, a failing
one-second leaked-handle deadline, and a five-minute watchdog with ten-second
termination grace. Native Server smoke/cluster targets consume two slots with
a two-test group limit and a ten-minute watchdog. Process-monitor mechanics use
their own two-test group. These limits prevent runaway tests; they are not
performance requirements and do not extend functional operation deadlines.
Doctests remain a separate Cargo command.

The ignored example is a public native-cluster integration case; the entry
supplies its required `NOVAROCKS_BIN` from the current prepared receipt. Internal
ignored mechanics helpers require their outer owner and private handshake inputs,
so ordinary examples do not select all ignored mechanics helpers.

## Formal execution

`tools/ci/local-full-ci.sh --cargo-only` retains its existing governance gates
and invokes `test-run.py batch`. The same wrapper can be invoked explicitly:

```bash
python3 tools/ci/test-run.py batch --output /absolute/local/unique-attempt
python3 tools/ci/test-run.py batch --output /absolute/local/another-attempt -- \
  -E 'package(novarocks-test-support)'
```

The destination must not exist. The containing filesystem must be local APFS,
ext, XFS, Btrfs or tmpfs. Containers must bind-mount a supported local state
directory; overlay root filesystems are rejected. The Python wrapper uses
capability checks, `os.posix_spawn(setpgroup=0, file_actions=..., setsigdef=...,
setsigmask=())` and `flock`; it supports system Python 3.9.6 without a Python
3.11 version gate. It does not require Python pidfd/kqueue APIs.

The batch retains distinct `rust-run/` and `doctest-run/` formal registration
contexts. Each contains `.formal`, `.pin`, `.gate`, the `closing`/`Closed` facts,
and its own monitor records. Closing a context never reopens it. The nextest
context is closed and checked before admitting independent doctests. An ordinary
nextest assertion failure (native exit 100) still runs doctests. Cancellation,
execution/environment failure, missing JUnit or incomplete/violated cleanup
gates later stages and records them as not started. A new final joint build and
build-info capture refresh the program bindings after doctest's Cargo command.
Its receipt is separate from the inputs describing what actually ran.

Each executor remains in the wrapper's session with an independent process
group. Nextest receives each observed INT/TERM/HUP/QUIT event exactly once at
its actual Child PID; Cargo/doctest receives group signals. TSTP is forwarded
to nextest; TTIN/TTOU normalize to TSTP. The wrapper stops itself only after
observing the child's stopped wait status. CONT resumes the actual executor;
cancellation while paused first resumes it. Pause confirmation has a five-second
deadline. Independently hosted payload monitors continue while the wrapper and
nextest are stopped. An already stopped wrapper requires CONT before Python can
process a pending HUP/TERM. SIGKILL/OOM/power loss cannot promise user-space
summarization; incomplete materials remain for the platform containment owner.

The local-full stage preserves the wrapper's inherited terminal descriptors.
Its `rust-batch.log` is an execution-index pointer and wrapper exit record;
executor raw output is already retained inside the batch. It does not redirect
display into that pointer log or add a second tee/capture layer. Closed inherited
stdio is reserved with owned null descriptors before record opens; spawn sources
are always separate CLOEXEC descriptors above 2. A post-spawn record/display
failure retains the original control error, cancels and actually waits the exact
executor, then still attempts normal registration sealing and summarization.
A pre-spawn failure also seals its domain independently, records `started=false`
with the original error, and retains any additional cleanup error.

Batch stdout/stderr go directly to exclusive raw files. Bounded daemon raw-FD
writers display incremental copies without blocking signal handling, wait or
cleanup. A broken/backpressured terminal does not change the raw result or
require a display flush at exit. The executor record reports display byte counts
and errors; the complete raw files remain authoritative. Cleanup uses one
thirty-second deadline from observed executor exit or handled cancellation,
covering gate closure and every record lock/read. It never kills payloads by
historical PID; test-support's independent monitors own those children.

## G15 interface: `execution-index.json`, schema 1

The batch root contains the schema-1 index from startup, initially
`complete=false`. Index updates are atomic. Monitor record inodes are never
replaced. Consumers use these declared references and native formats, rather
than human log layout or an invented test-result classification.

| Index field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schema` | `1`; reject unsupported versions. |
| `source` | Exact source commit, dirty flag and scoped Git status; no full environment dump. |
| `arguments`, `cargo_profile`, `nextest_profile`, `nextest_version` | Original native selection, actual profiles and raw tool self-report. |
| `materials` | Relative `path`, `format`, existence/readability facts for metadata, selection, configuration, bindings, JUnit and both cleanup summaries. |
| `stages` | Preparation, manifest prerequisite, nextest, independent doctest, final preparation. Each has `started` and native `returncode`, or the reason it did not start. |
| Executor stage | Actual argv/cwd, `material_root`, local stdout/stderr names, native wait status/exit, signal events, observed stopped/continued events and display completeness. The same facts are in that stage's `executor.json`. |
| `cancelled`, `error`, `exit_code` | Original cancellation events, stage failure explanation and wrapper outcome. |
| `complete` | Required execution/report/cleanup facts were collected. It does not mean tests passed; native nonzero exits remain nonzero. |

Native inputs are in `inputs/`: `cargo-metadata.json`,
`binaries-metadata.json`, `selected-tests.json`, `artifacts.json.cargo.jsonl`,
`artifacts.json`, `test-artifacts.json`, raw `build-info/`, and actual configuration
copies/hashes in `prepared.json`. `final-prepare/` owns the later joint build and
program receipt used by subsequent SQL/System consumers. JUnit is exclusively
`nextest/<profile>/junit.xml`, selected with an attempt-specific tool config's
`[store].dir`. A missing or truncated JUnit is explicitly incomplete; the wrapper
never fabricates or rewrites native JUnit. Doctest retains Cargo/rustdoc raw text
and native exit; it does not manufacture stable Cargo doctest JSON or JUnit.

Each domain's `cleanup-summary.json` schema 1 declares `registration_closed`,
`complete`, `ok`, `records`, `late_registrations` and `errors`. Each record entry
references `monitor/<launch>/record.jsonl`, stdout/stderr, the original `native`
identity map, its `Final`, completeness and violations. A separate caller
diagnostic may be retained at
`monitor/<launch>/caller-drop-error.txt`. If this regular file exists, the entry's
`caller_drop_error` references its relative path and `violations` records the
caller cleanup failure, even when the monitor later publishes a successful
`Final`. The wrapper retains the original file without reading, parsing or
copying its text. A symlink or another nonregular diagnostic is an explicit
incomplete-material error. The producer's JSONL
events all use schema 1: `Pending`, `Spawned`, optional nonterminal `Liveness`,
`ExitObserved`, and `Final`; `CleanupIncomplete` or a missing/partial Final stays
incomplete. `Final` preserves nullable `status_raw`/`startup_error`, `owner_lost`,
`errors` and `cleanup_complete`. A payload's nonzero exit alone is not a cleanup
violation. Owner loss/startup failure/cleanup errors remain distinct from the
test's native result. Shared flock descriptions are only closed, never unlocked.
Formal contexts are excluded from ordinary release/retention GC.

The ownership ruling is recorded in
[ADR-0184](../../docs/adr/ADR-0184-native-test-execution-and-process-monitor-ownership.md).

G15 stores derived selection/reuse decisions beside these inputs. It must not
write its conclusions into native results or this G6a-owned index. A path on one
machine is local evidence until the full referenced materials have an explicit
shared retention owner.

## Development selection and evidence composition

`dev-verify.sh` consumes canonical preparation, native SQL/System
`--list-declarations`, Cargo metadata and nextest discovery, plus the named stages
from `local-full-ci.sh --list-stages`. Rust selection uses native `rdeps()`;
[impact rules](verification/impact-rules.json) supplement owner declarations.
Mapping gaps remain visible and expand to a bounded owner domain or broad
coverage. This selector is development-only. Admission derives the fixed regular
collection, without consulting the impact graph; G17 owns formal execution,
merge-commit enforcement, trust, scheduling and shared registration storage.

```bash
tools/ci/dev-verify.sh plan --base origin/main --root /absolute/local/task-evidence
tools/ci/dev-verify.sh run --base origin/main --root /absolute/local/task-evidence
tools/ci/dev-verify.sh resume --base origin/main --root /absolute/local/task-evidence
tools/ci/dev-verify.sh compose --base origin/main --root /absolute/local/task-evidence
tools/ci/dev-verify.sh check-declarations --root /absolute/local/declaration-evidence
tools/ci/dev-verify.sh confirm-cleanup /absolute/local/task-evidence/actual-attempt
```

Without `--prepared`, these commands first prepare the canonical workspace graph.
`--prepared /absolute/path/to/inputs` revalidates an existing canonical preparation.
`plan` reports selection/scopes, reasons, expansion gaps and heavy author
obligations; `run` creates an exclusive attempt; `resume` recomposes old records
and executes unsatisfied scopes. `compose` writes a fresh derived record. A root
can hold multiple independent attempts and compositions; preserve the whole set.
Actual SQL execution requires `NOVAROCKS_SQL_TEST_CONFIG` and the declared fixture
publication/dataset inputs. Do not rebuild the same target concurrently.

Development selection retains individual Rust test and workspace doctest
obligations. The native `workspace nextest and doctests` stage remains in the
inventory as an admission/full obligation; its development projection is
explicitly deferred to admission before reading results. Deferred stage failures
and unresolved cleanup remain visible in `deferred_scopes` and can still block
the development conclusion. Individual passes never manufacture a stage PASS.

Current G6a batch always includes nextest and independent doctest. If a resume's
entire unmet target set consists only of workspace doctest, the tool may run one
normal batch with one already satisfied, identity-matching regular nextest scope.
Before launch, `selection.json.resume_exception` records the reason, pending and
repeated scopes, prior qualifying execution, exact filterset and batch output.
The derived composition retains this reference. New failures in the repeated
scope enter the normal conflict rules; old cancellation and cleanup facts remain.
With no eligible regular scope, or another unmet target, the gap stays `not_run`.
This exception never uses helpers/manual/heavy tests to fill an empty selection,
creates no doctest executor/index, and does not retry the batch in a loop.
The CLI's `compose --layer admission` is labelled `local-rehearsal`, never a
formal admission receipt. A wrapper's formal process-registration context does
not establish a trusted formal source. Full-layer composition and registration
are library interfaces for G17; this entry does not schedule full runs.

### G15 retained materials

| Material | Owner facts and consumer boundary |
|---|---|
| `identity/source-start.json`, `source-end.json` | Exact commit, dirty/untracked status and source tree snapshots; they establish provenance, not executable identity. Dirty local attempts remain usable only within development rules. |
| Rust `identity/nextest.json`, `doctest.json` | Per-scope input snapshots at start/end, declared runtime/environment inputs, actual program/test/config hashes, profiles and stability confirmation. Missing declarations prevent historical reuse. The separately executed monitor binary is an explicit runtime input. |
| `execution-index.json` checkpoints | Atomically committed after nextest and its cleanup/identity confirmation, then after doctest. A killed later domain leaves the earlier independent checkpoint available; missing whole-attempt completion cannot invent the later result. |
| `invocations/*.started.json`, final `*.json` | Immutable pre-execution selection/argv/cwd/source and start identity; final native exit, end identity/stability, raw log and material references. A started record without a final remains incomplete. |
| System `scenario-teardown.json` | Schema 1 fixture/cluster cleanup facts, partial startup monitor responsibility and external resources, separate from schema 5 scenario evidence. Total process exit is not cleanup proof. |
| External resource registration | Atomic pre-side-effect owner/id/label/PID fact and released/cleanup_failed settlement; recursive collection preserves unsettled or corrupt records. Registration is no deletion authority. See [System owner rule](../../tests/system-test-runner/README.md#声明与收束材料). |
| SQL `--results-file` | Schema 1 JSONL run, full selection, terminal case, suite lifecycle and final end facts. Case identity, declared/executed oracle and policy, effective verification, failure fingerprints and snapshots remain native producer facts. Missing end or required cleanup prevents reuse of the affected scope. |
| `selection.json`, `compositions/*/composition.json` | Native units and scopes selected before execution; derived source/result/completeness/applicability/disposition, retained counterexamples, deferrals and cleanup obligations. They never modify JUnit, SQL records, scenario evidence or the G6a index. |
| `cleanup-confirmation.json` | Independent observation of exact recorded resources or monitor facts. `confirm-cleanup` queries containers, networks and volumes with the recorded Compose label; it performs no cleanup. `--observation` preserves supplemental manual material but does not itself discharge obligations. |
| Registration delta | `verification/registration.py` derives new/still-failing/last-pass-open/closed/infrastructure/quarantine states. A later pass alone does not close a failure; closure needs a linked fix and qualifying revalidation. No shared issue service is created. |

[dispositions.json](baselines/dispositions.json) supplies expiring, owned exact SQL
failure fingerprints and quarantine records. It does not rewrite raw failures or
excuse missing execution, diagnostic-only verification or cleanup violations.
[Layer rules](../../docs/guides/development/test-governance.md#三层验证与证据组合)
define eligible evidence and conclusion wording. Local paths and local admission
rehearsals remain local until G17 provides the trusted formal ownership and
recoverable shared materials.

## Focused verification

```bash
bash tools/ci/tests/local-full-ci-classification-test.sh
bash tools/ci/tests/system-scenarios-stage-test.sh
python3 tools/ci/tests/test-run-test.py
```

The Python suite uses controlled executors for lifecycle/control-flow checks and,
when nextest is installed, a dependency-free real Rust fixture with its own
target. Mocked scripts prove command/selection control flow, not NovaRocks product
execution. Native Linux x86_64 remains a separate required validation target;
Linux arm64, QEMU or cross-compilation does not satisfy that requirement.
Set `NOVA_CI_TEST_EVIDENCE_ROOT` to a unique directory to retain generated fixture
sources, actual commands, raw outputs and indices; rebuildable fixture target
caches stay in the worktree and are removed after verification. The governance
entry retains these regression materials under its own run directory.

When simple native tests are unexpectedly slow on macOS, follow the official
[nextest macOS Developer Tools guidance](https://nexte.st/docs/installation/macos/)
and inspect actual executions as needed. The entry does not automatically change
system authorization or treat a microbenchmark as a performance gate.
