-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate RANGE UNBOUNDED PRECEDING TO CURRENT ROW semantics.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in RANGE frame ordering behavior.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows with duplicate order keys.
-- 3. Compute RANGE-frame SUM and assert output.
