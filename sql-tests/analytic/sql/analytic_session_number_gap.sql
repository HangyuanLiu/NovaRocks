-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate session_number gap-splitting semantics under ordered partitions.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where session boundaries are miscomputed across large gaps.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic timestamp-like integer sequences by group.
-- 3. Compute session_number with fixed gap threshold and assert ordered output.
