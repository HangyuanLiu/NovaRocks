-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate filtering over window outputs via subquery.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in window + outer predicate integration.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows per partition.
-- 3. Apply ROW_NUMBER in subquery and keep top-2 rows per partition.
