-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate UNNEST with outer-column-dependent array expressions.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in correlated lateral table-function execution.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Build deterministic outer rows.
-- 2. Derive per-row arrays with IF expression.
-- 3. Expand with UNNEST and assert ordered output.
