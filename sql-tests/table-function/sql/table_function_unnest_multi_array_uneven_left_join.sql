-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate LEFT JOIN LATERAL UNNEST zip behavior for uneven multi-array lengths.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in NULL-padding semantics for shorter array arguments.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Build deterministic outer rows.
-- 2. Derive per-row multi-array arguments with uneven lengths and NULL arrays.
-- 3. LEFT JOIN LATERAL UNNEST and assert ordered padded output.
