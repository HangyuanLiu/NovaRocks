-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate LEFT JOIN LATERAL UNNEST for empty/NULL arrays.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where unmatched outer rows are dropped.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Build deterministic outer rows.
-- 2. Produce non-empty, empty, and NULL arrays per row.
-- 3. LEFT JOIN LATERAL UNNEST and assert ordered output.
