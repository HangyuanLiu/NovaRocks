-- r is intentionally an order of magnitude smaller than l (100 vs 1000 rows)
-- while keeping comparable per-key NDV, so r is unambiguously the smaller
-- broadcast/build side. With equal-sized sides the build-side choice is a cost
-- tie whose tie-break varies with per-thread HashMap seeds, which made the
-- recorded plan-tree shape flaky under parallel workers. Commutativity is also
-- pinned for good measure; the objective here is the multi-key cardinality
-- estimate, not the join order.
