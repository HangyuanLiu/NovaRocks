-- @tags=optimizer,session_rule_disable
-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Verify SET disable_optimizer_rules = 'JoinCommutativity' changes plan shape.
-- 2. Two EXPLAIN VERBOSE statements; the .result captures both and the
--    diff between them is the join order / distribution type.
-- Design note:
-- The query is an INNER JOIN written as date_dim LEFT, lineorder RIGHT.
-- JoinReorder is disabled for both EXPLAINs so the only remaining mechanism
-- that can swap the two-table join in Cascades is JoinCommutativity.
-- With JoinCommutativity: CBO swaps to lineorder LEFT (probe) + date_dim RIGHT
--   so the tiny date_dim table is the broadcast build side.
-- Without JoinCommutativity: CBO cannot swap, so lineorder remains on the
--   original right side.
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ${case_db}.lineorder;

CREATE TABLE ${case_db}.lineorder (lo_orderkey INT, lo_datekey INT, lo_revenue INT);
CREATE TABLE ${case_db}.date_dim (d_datekey INT, d_year INT);
INSERT INTO ${case_db}.lineorder
    SELECT generate_series, 19980101 + (generate_series % 2), generate_series * 10
    FROM TABLE(generate_series(1, 20000));
INSERT INTO ${case_db}.date_dim VALUES (19980101, 1998), (19980102, 1998);

-- Baseline: keep query-rewrite join reorder off, but allow Cascades
-- JoinCommutativity.

-- Expected: CBO swaps to lineorder LEFT + date_dim RIGHT (BROADCAST, INNER).
EXPLAIN VERBOSE

-- Without commutativity: cannot swap, date_dim stays LEFT and lineorder
-- remains on the original right side.
