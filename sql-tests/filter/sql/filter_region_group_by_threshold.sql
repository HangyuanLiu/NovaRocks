-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate filtered GROUP BY counting with a numeric threshold predicate.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where this case assumes SSB customer table availability.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset a minimal customer-like table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic key/region rows around the threshold.
-- 3. Aggregate filtered rows by region and order result deterministically.
