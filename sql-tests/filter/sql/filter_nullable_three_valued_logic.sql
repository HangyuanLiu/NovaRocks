-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate three-valued boolean predicate behavior in WHERE filtering.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where NULL predicate results are treated as TRUE.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table with nullable numeric columns.
-- 2. Insert rows that produce TRUE/FALSE/NULL predicate outcomes.
-- 3. Filter with nullable predicate plus OR branch and assert deterministic output.
