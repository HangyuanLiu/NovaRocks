-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate combined Filter->Project->Sort->Limit pipeline behavior.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in end-to-end row selection after expression projection.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows with NULL and non-NULL metrics.
-- 3. Execute combined query and assert ordered top rows.
