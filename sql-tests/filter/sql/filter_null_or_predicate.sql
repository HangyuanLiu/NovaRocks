-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate OR predicate behavior when one side depends on IS NULL checks.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in boolean short-circuit style evaluation for nullable columns.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert rows covering NULL and non-NULL combinations.
-- 3. Filter with OR predicate and assert deterministic ordering.
