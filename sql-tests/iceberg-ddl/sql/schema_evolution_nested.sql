-- Nested STRUCT add / drop / rename / widen DDL end-to-end.
-- Note: NovaRocks's standalone INSERT path doesn't yet support STRUCT
-- column writes, so this test exercises the DDL pipeline only and
-- confirms that nested-path SELECT projection still resolves after
-- each ALTER. Data-level coverage of the nested schema is provided by
-- unit tests in `connector::iceberg::catalog::schema_update`.
