-- Test Point: Iceberg v3 deletion-vector DELETE works across historical partition specs
-- Method: create a v3 row-lineage bucket-partitioned table, insert old-spec rows, evolve to a new bucket spec, insert new-spec rows, delete rows from both specs, and verify remaining rows
-- Scope: standalone Iceberg table DDL, INSERT INTO, SELECT, DELETE FROM, v3 row-lineage deletion vectors
