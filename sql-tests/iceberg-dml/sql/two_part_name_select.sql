-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate `INSERT INTO db.t1 SELECT FROM db.t2` resolves both 2-part refs
--    under the active catalog (no USE / no current database).
-- 2. Validate standalone `SELECT FROM db.t` resolves the 2-part ref too.
-- Regression guard for: 2-part `db.table` refs failing with "unknown database"
-- in the SELECT-FROM path before the resolver fix.
