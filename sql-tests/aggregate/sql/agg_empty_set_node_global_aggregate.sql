-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate EMPTY_SET_NODE lowering for global aggregate queries.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where EMPTY_SET_NODE fails at plan lowering.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Build a deterministic inline relation with one non-null and one null row.
-- 2. Force an empty input with a constant-false predicate.
-- 3. Assert aggregate null/count semantics on zero rows.
