-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate COUNT(DISTINCT a,b) for composite key distinctness.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in multi-column distinct cardinality.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic duplicated and distinct value pairs.
-- 3. Compute COUNT(DISTINCT a,b) and assert scalar output.
