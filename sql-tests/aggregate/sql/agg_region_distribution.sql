-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate GROUP BY region distribution counting behavior.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where this case assumes pre-existing SSB customer data.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset a minimal customer-like table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows spanning all expected regions.
-- 3. Aggregate by region and order output for stable comparison.
