-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate BOOL_OR aggregation over grouped predicates.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in boolean aggregation with NULL rows.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows including NULL.
-- 3. Aggregate predicate truth values by group and assert output.
