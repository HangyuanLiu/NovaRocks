-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate grouped COUNT/SUM/AVG semantics with nullable inputs.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where NULL handling changes aggregate outputs.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Create/reset aggregate source table.
-- 2. Insert deterministic rows across groups with NULLs.
-- 3. Aggregate by group and assert ordered output.
