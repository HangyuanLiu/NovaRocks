-- Test Objective:
-- Freeze the user-facing `SHOW MATERIALIZED VIEWS` projection.
--
-- The first SHOW runs against a database with no materialized views: the row
-- set is empty, so the recorded golden is exactly the column projection — every
-- column name, its order, and by construction the column count. That keeps the
-- shape assertion free of the per-run catalog/database/name identifiers that
-- would otherwise make a populated row unstable.
--
-- The second SHOW then covers the per-column values that are stable across
-- runs. The volatile cells (names, base-table paths, timestamps) are
-- deliberately not asserted here; `mv_lifecycle_edges` and the ivm suite own
-- the behaviour those cells describe.
