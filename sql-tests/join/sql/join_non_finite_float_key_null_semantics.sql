-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate non-finite floating-point expressions are normalized to NULL.
-- 2. Prevent regressions where NaN/Infinity keys are matched by equality hash join.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Build deterministic left/right inline datasets containing non-finite and finite keys.
-- 2. Assert non-finite keys become NULL on both sides.
-- 3. Assert INNER JOIN on equality only matches the finite key.
