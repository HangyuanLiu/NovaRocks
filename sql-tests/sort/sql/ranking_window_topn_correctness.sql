-- @tags=sort,oq13,ranking_window_topn_correctness
-- Test Objective: Verify RankingWindowPredicatePushdown correctness — results must be
-- IDENTICAL whether the rule is ON (default) or OFF (SET disable_optimizer_rules=...).
-- Covers: rank()=1, rank()<=k with tie at boundary, dense_rank()<=k with ties,
--         row_number()<=k, NULL ORDER BY values, single-row partition,
--         and a scalar subquery with a rank window.
-- The rule fires by inserting partition_limit=K into the analytic Sort; the Filter and
-- Window nodes are preserved, so per-partition truncation must not alter the result set.
