-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate ORDER BY behavior when CASE branches include CAST expressions that can produce non-finite float values.
-- 2. Ensure non-finite branch results are normalized to NULL before sorting.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Build deterministic rows with nullable float values.
-- 2. Compute CASE output with CAST('NaN'/'Infinity'/'-Infinity').
-- 3. Sort with explicit NULL ordering and deterministic tie-breakers.
