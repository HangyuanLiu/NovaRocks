-- Migrated from dev/test/sql/test_function/T/test_date_format
-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate DATE_FORMAT with microsecond format specifier (%f) on varchar-stored datetime values.
-- 2. Validate LENGTH of DATE_FORMAT output with long literal strings in format.
-- 3. Validate IFNULL wrapping of LENGTH(DATE_FORMAT(...)) for edge-case format strings.
