-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate nested MAP<key,ARRAY> access and downstream array aggregation.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in nested complex-type expression evaluation.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Build nested MAP and ARRAY expressions.
-- 2. Extract nested array by key.
-- 3. Aggregate extracted array and assert scalar outputs.
