-- Test Objective:
-- 1. Validate MONEY_FORMAT formatting for decimal, bigint, and double inputs.
-- 2. Prevent regressions in thousands separators and double-style fractional formatting.
-- Test Flow:
-- 1. Evaluate MONEY_FORMAT on numeric constants with explicit types.
-- 2. Compare decimal/bigint outputs and double outputs in the same row.
-- 3. Assert deterministic scalar outputs.
